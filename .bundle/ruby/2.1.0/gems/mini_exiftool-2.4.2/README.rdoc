= MiniExiftool

This library is wrapper for the Exiftool command-line application
(http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool) written by Phil Harvey.
Read and write access is done in a clean OO manner.

== Requirements

Ruby 1.9 or higher and an installation of the Exiftool
command-line application at least version 7.65.
If you run on Ruby 1.8 or with a prior exiftool version
install mini_exiftool version 1.x.x.
Instructions for installation you can find under
http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/install.html .

Alternatively Wil Gieseler has bundled a meta-gem that eliminates the
need for a separate Exiftool installation. Have a look at
http://github.com/wilg/mini_exiftool_vendored or
http://rubygems.org/gems/mini_exiftool_vendored .

== Installation

First you need Exiftool (see under Requirements above). Then you can simply
install the gem with
 gem install mini_exiftool

If you need to support older versions of Ruby or exiftool (see Requirements above)
  gem install --version "< 2.0.0" mini_exiftool

== Usage

In general MiniExiftool is very intuitive to use as the following examples show:

 # Reading meta data
 photo = MiniExiftool.new 'photo.jpg'
 puts photo.title

 # Writing meta data
 photo = MiniExiftool.new 'photo.jpg'
 photo.title = 'This is the new title'
 photo.save

 # Copying meta data
 photo = MiniExiftool.new('photo.jpg')
 photo.copy_tags_from('another_photo.jpg', :author)


For further information about using MiniExiftool read the Tutorial.rdoc
in the project root folder and have a look at the examples in directory
examples.
